It's ugly. It matches old Arcadius UI. The game was better looking. i'm no artist.

This is the ugliest code you'll see this week.

It was made on the fly. I'm not proud. It works.

I changed the structure of everything and decided to make a big file global_data with everything inside after i had made the 1st script and i didnt take time to refactor the whole thing or to make cleaner function to draw html tables.

In my hobbies, my programming is like a hobo. Dirty, bad looking, smelly, but it can travel anywhere without problem.

But at work i'm a god. I don't work with JS or web. My boss let me refactor the main project. The whole project. The core of the company. The code that is in every single device we sell. The code is clean. Variables are sorted and ordered (i work on low level hardware and i manage memory bit by bit, i set the address on all my variables). Functions and variables names are handpicked by me. The whole codebase is made to be taken over by anyone with at least 2 years of programming and be used simply. The code is so clean that i can only print it on silk. Yeah i'm proud of this code. It's my baby.

Well i digressed. My code here is trash. I know it. Don't tell me.
