This is the ugliest code you'll see this week.

It was made on the fly. I'm not proud. It works.

I changed the structure of everything and decided to make a big file global_data with everything inside after i had made the 1st script and i didnt take time to refactor the whole thing or to make cleaner function to draw html tables.
